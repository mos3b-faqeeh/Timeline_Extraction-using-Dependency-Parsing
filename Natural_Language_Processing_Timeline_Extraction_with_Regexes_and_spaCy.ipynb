Think about news articles, social media messages, reports, e-mails etc. Often we are interested in finding out if some event happend - and when it happend.

The difficulty is to come up with a pattern to capture the many ways a date can be written (e.g. \"in april 1975\" or \"in the spring of 1975\" etc.). A second difficulty is to identify numbers or expressions where we can be reasonable sure that the number signifies a date and not something else. Look at the following sentence: *Charlemagne ended 200 years of Royal Lombard rule with the Siege of Pavia, and in 774 he installed himself as King of the Lombards*. There are two numbers (200 and 774) which could be dates, but only one of them is in fact a date.\n",

As an example, we could define a pattern like this: **In** `[DATE]`**,** `[EVENT]`. In the example above, this would capture the following event: *in 774 he installed himself as King of the Lombards*.\n",
